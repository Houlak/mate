## Key Features

### Intuitive Log Visualization
Mate enables you to effortlessly load and view log files generated by HKLogger in a more intuitive and developer-centric manner. Say goodbye to traditional console interfaces and welcome a modern, user-friendly log viewing experience.

### Powerful Filtering Options
With Mate, you can easily filter logs based on severity, type, and date, allowing you to focus on specific areas of interest. Whether you're troubleshooting critical errors or analyzing networking logs, Mate empowers you with powerful filtering capabilities.

### Effortless Log Search
The built-in search functionality of Mate lets you quickly locate specific log entries by using keywords. This feature saves you time by narrowing down the logs to relevant information, ensuring a smooth debugging experience.

### Flexible Log Sorting
Mate equips you with the ability to sort logs based on various criteria, providing a customizable view of your log data. Sort logs by severity, timestamp, or any other desired parameter, allowing you to gain insights in the most efficient way possible.

### Real-time UI Updates
Mate dynamically updates its user interface to reflect any changes made to the log file. Whenever a new line is added, Mate instantly renders the updated UI, ensuring you always have access to the latest log entries without any manual intervention.

## Requirements

MacOS 13.0+ (Ventura).

## How does it works?

- Upload your logs file to Mate ðŸ§‰. Psss: if youâ€™re developing an iOS app, you can use [HKLogger](https://github.com/Houlak/hklogger) in it, 
which is a library that creates and handle all the logging logic for you. Besides, it works perfectly with Mate!
- Visualize your logs as you usually do in your IDEâ€™s console but with all the extra power that Mate provides.
- Continue with your debugging process. Every time that your log file is updated, Mate will render the new log entries automatically!

## What format must the logs follow?

We have created a default format to render the logs in Mate. This format is the one that we use in [HKLogger](https://github.com/Houlak/hklogger), so if you're an iOS dev, we highly encourage you to use `HKLogger` in your app.

```
{TIMESTAMP} - [{SEVERITY}] [{TYPE}] {OPTIONAL METADATA}: {MESSAGE}^^^
```

- `TIMESTAMP` The date must follow this format: yyyy-mm-ddThh:MM:ss.
- `SEVERITY` The log severity can be any of these values: `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`.
- `TYPE` The log type can be any of these values: `ANALYTICS`, `NETWORKING`, `TRACE`, `HEALTH`, `DEFAULT`.
- `METADATA` This field is optional, but could be useful if you want to add extra information from the log itself.
  In case you decide to include it, it has to follow the following format:
  `[THREAD] [FILE] [FUNCTION] [LINE]`.
- `MESSAGE` Include whatever you want regarding the log you've added. 
  
### Bonus track
If any of your logs has a `NETWORKING` type, you could format the messsage like this, in order to be properly rendered in Mate ðŸ§‰:

```json
{ 
  "method": String,
  "path": String,
  "request": { 
    "headers": { ... }, // Optional
    "body": {... } }, // Optional
  "response": { 
    "status": Integer, 
    "headers": { ... }, // Optional
    "body": { ... } // Optional
    } 
}
```

> This is all handle for free if you use `HKLogger`

**Note:** It's necessary to add `^^^` at the end of each log, because this string will work as a separator for all the logs within the file uploaded.

### Example
```
2023-01-1T14:00:00 - [INFO] [TRACE] [main] [Logger.swift] [logMessage()] [Line 100]: The app has started^^^
2023-01-1T14:05:00 - [INFO] [ANALYTICS] [<NSThread: 0x6000015d82c0>{number = 10, name = (null)}] [Logger.swift] [logMessage()] [Line 100]: Login button tapped^^^
2023-01-1T14:05:45 - [DEBUG] [NETWORKING]:
{
    "method": "GET", "path": "api/test-endpoint", "request": { 
        "headers": { "Authorization": "dummy token" }
    },
    "response": {
        "statusCode": 404,"body": {"errorCode": "404", "message": "Account not found"}
    }
}^^^
2023-01-1T14:07:30 - [WARNING] [HEALTH]: Network request failed with status code 404^^^
```
