# Terms of use

These Terms of Use govern your use of the Mate application.
By accessing and using Mate, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and the Privacy Policy. If you do not accept these Terms and the Privacy Policy, you are not authorized to use the Services. We may modify these Terms and the Privacy Policy at any time and such modification will be effective upon posting to the Application.

### PRIVACY POLICY

For information about how we collect and use information about users of the Service, please check out our privacy policy available at: [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/Houlak/mate/blob/main/PrivacyPolicy/Policy.md).

### SUBSCRIPTION

Some parts of the Application are billed on a subscription basis. You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis. Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
Your Subscription will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.
Your Subscription will automatically renew at the end of your Subscription period unless canceled at least 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.
You can manage your Subscription or turn off auto-renewal at any time from your iTunes account settings. Cancellation of the active Subscription period is not allowed.
All Subscriptions may be final and non-refundable. By accepting these terms, you agree that we are not required to provide a refund for any reason.
We may change, modify, or eliminate features of the Subscription at any time, with or without notice. 

**Subscription Fee Changes**
We, in our sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will not go into effect automatically; you must opt into the fee change to continue using the Subscription after the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
